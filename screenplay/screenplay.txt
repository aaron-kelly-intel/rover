The rover sits in the middle of stage, switched off.
  
  Announcer
  We'd like to present to you our Rover,
  the culmination of our learning and time
  spent at Intel over the past 10 weeks.
  The rover comes equipped with a number of
  sensors built-in, thanks to the Intel Curie
  chip.
  To control and communicate with the rover,
  we have also built an app. Let's switch it on.
  
The rover bursts into life with a power-on sound

  Rover
  Good morning!

  Announcer
  The rover is able to be controlled manually...
  
The announcer presses the directional keys on the app.

  Rover
  (taking off suddenly)
  ... woah!
  
  Announcer
  Our app comes with a directional pad
  for movement, with constant feedback from
  the rover on the terrain conditions.
  
  Rover
  You know, I really would prefer to do the 
  driving... stastistically, machines are a lot safer
  
  Announcer
  (pressing button)
  We can also have the rover operate autonomously.
  Ok, you're free to go.
  
The rover is released from manual control, and sits there doing nothing.

  Announcer
  You can go now.
  
  Rover
  Stastistically, it's a lot safer to stay right here.

-- IMU SECTION --
-----------------
  
The announcer walks over to the rover, it's LED
cube flashing casually.

  Announcer
  We tried to explore as many of the on-board features
  as we could...
  
The announcer bends down and picks up the rover, turning it upside-down.

  Rover
  Woah, careful!
  
  Announcer
  Which includes the Curie IMU, which is comprised
  of a gyroscope and accelerometer. We have built
  a LED cube that responds not only it's position
  in space... but also to shock.

  Rover
  That may just leave a mark, you know
  
The announcer puts the rover back on the ground.

  Announcer
  Now be a good rover and go do some science

-- SENSOR SECTION --
--------------------

  Rover
  As an advanced science rover I'm hooked
  into all the latest stuff!
  
Other Genuino 101's around the stage start to beep and flash. The rover turns toword the first sensor

  Rover
  Hello! What kind of sensor are you? (pause)
  Ahh! You've been collecting weather data! 
  Let me download what you have...
  According to the sensor, the current
  temperature is 427 degrees celsius and 
  5000 percent humidity.
  (pause)
  Wait... sorry, I think that's some bad
  soldering. Displaying weather data on the
  app.
  
The sensor information is displayed on the projector

  Announcer
  Thank you all for your attention, on behalf
  of the tema it was a pleasure working at 
  Intel for the summer.
